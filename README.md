# Islamopedia
This is an open-source project created to build a tool that helps people learn about Islam. The long-term plan is to train AI to help scholars in doing research, comparative analysis, crafting research papers, journals, or even books, and a layman to have everything about Islam in their hands.

The first and most important purpose is to break the language barrier to read about **must-known** things. The second most important purpose is to build a community working together and providing high-quality work by ensuring strict quality standards. We want to bring critical thinking and comparative analysis into a visible and accessible academic discourse instead of just talking about it. It will help the scholars to research each single Hadees by having all the books of Hadith, Biographies, and other scholars' comments in one place. It is going to be fun. InshaAllah

_**One issue will be created and referenced here for each point, Further details can be discussed over there in that specific context.**_

## Following are the basic initial components that we are going to add to our website.
1. A good Book reading tool with a couple of cool features [#1](/../../issues/1)
2. Each book must have general information about it [#2](/../../issues/2)
3. A good document writer with a cool referencing mechanism
4. A good PDF generator to download the book and save it for later use
5. A transparent way of reviewing all of the texts that are being uploaded [#3](/../../issues/3)
