# Islamopedia
This open-source project was created to build a tool that helps people learn about Islam. The long-term plan is to train AI to help scholars in doing research, comparative analysis, and crafting research papers, journals, or even books.

The main purpose is to break the language barrier to read about **must-known** things. We will build a community working together and providing high-quality work by ensuring strict quality standards. 

_**One issue will be created and referenced here for each point, Further details can be discussed over there in that specific context.**_

## Following are the basic initial components that we are going to add to our website.
1. A good Book reading tool with a couple of cool features [#1](/../../issues/1)
2. Each book must have general information about it [#2](/../../issues/2)
3. A good document writer with a cool referencing mechanism
4. A good PDF generator to download the book and save it for later use
5. A transparent way of reviewing all of the texts that are being uploaded [#3](/../../issues/3)
7. A list of books which are on the track coming ahead
    1. Books of Fiqh
      2. All popular Fiqh books
    2. Biographies
      1. Ahl-e-Bait
      2. Ummahat-ul-Momineen
      3. Sahaba and Sahabiat
      4. Prophet PBUH (The reason why it is kept on the last is because we already have a lot of content online, but for the above points we have almost nothing)
