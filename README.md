# Islamopedia
This open-source project was created to build a tool that helps people learn about Islam. The long-term plan is to train AI to help scholars in doing research and crafting research papers, journals, or even books.

_**One issue will be created and referenced here for each point, Further details can be discussed over there in that specific context.**_

## Following are the basic initial components that we are going to add to our website.
1. A good Book reading tool with a couple of cool features #1
2. Each book must have general information about it #2 
3. A good document writer with a cool referencing mechanism
4. A good PDF generator to download the book and save it for later use.
5. A transparent way of reviewing all of the texts which are being uploaded.
7. A list of books which are on the track coming ahead
    1. Books of fiqh are on priority as we don’t have them in our online world now
    2. Biographies of Ashab and relationships to Prophet PBUH and other things are on 2nd priority as we don’t have much information about them online currently
    3. Books regarding the biographies of our Imams or great leaders e.g. Four Imams, Sihah Sitah Imams, Khulafa Rashidin, Ahl-e-Bait, Um-ul-Momineen
